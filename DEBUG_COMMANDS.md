# Debug Commands Reference

Complete guide to all debug/cheat commands for testing!

## Why Number Keys Instead of F-Keys?

On macOS, F-keys are used for system functions (brightness, volume, etc.). Using number keys is more convenient and doesn't conflict with macOS shortcuts!

## Notes for macOS Users

### F-Key Workarounds (if you really want F-keys):
1. Hold **Fn** key + F1-F11
2. Or change macOS settings:
   - System Preferences â†’ Keyboard
   - Check "Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys"

### But Number Keys are Better!
- No conflicts with system functions
- Easier to reach while gaming
- Works on both keyboard types (with/without numpad)

---

## Customizing Key Bindings

Want to change the keys? Edit `DebugCommands.cs`:

```csharp
// Example: Change "1" to "P" for Add XP
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.P))
{
    AddXP();
}

// Example: Change "5" to "LeftBracket" for Spawn Bots
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.LeftBracket))
{
    SpawnBots();
}
```

Common KeyCode options:
- Alpha1-0 (number row)
- Keypad1-0 (numpad)
- LeftBracket, RightBracket
- Semicolon, Quote
- Period, Comma
- P, O, I, U, Y (letter keys)

---

## Demo Mode vs Debug Commands

### Demo Mode (GameManager):
- Unlimited money in buy menu
- Can buy anytime
- No round restrictions

### Debug Commands:
- Quick testing tools
- Instant XP, levels, money
- Bot spawning control
- Health manipulation

**Use both together for maximum testing power!** ðŸš€

## Production Build

### Before releasing your game:
1. **Disable Debug Commands**:
   - Uncheck "Enable Debug Commands" on GameManager
   - Or remove DebugCommands component entirely

2. **Disable Demo Mode**:
   - Uncheck "Demo Mode" on GameManager

3. **Optional - Remove Script**:
   - Delete `DebugCommands.cs` from project
   - This prevents cheating in released game

**Happy Testing!** ðŸŽ®âœ¨
