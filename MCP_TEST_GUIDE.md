# MCP Unity Connection Test Guide

## What I Created

I've added **MCPConnectionTest.cs** - A Unity Editor script with menu commands to test the MCP connection and create test objects.

## How to Test

### In Unity Editor:

1. **Open Unity** (if not already open)
2. Go to menu: **Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Test MCP Connection**
3. This will:
   - Create a green test cube at position (0, 1, 0)
   - Select it in the hierarchy
   - Show a success dialog

### Additional Test Commands:

**Create Test Scene:**
- Menu: **Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Create Test Scene Objects**
- Creates:
  - Ground plane (10x10)
  - Test player with CharacterController
  - Camera at eye level
  - Ready to press Play and test!

**Clear Test Objects:**
- Menu: **Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Clear Test Objects**
- Removes all test objects when done

## What This Tests

âœ… **Unity Editor Scripting** - Confirms scripts can execute in editor
âœ… **GameObject Creation** - Tests runtime object creation
âœ… **Component Assignment** - Tests adding components
âœ… **Material/Rendering** - Tests visual representation
âœ… **Scene Manipulation** - Tests hierarchy operations

## MCP Connection Status

The Unity MCP package is installed:
- Package: `com.gamelovers.mcp-unity`
- Source: https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity.git
- Status: âœ… Installed in Packages/manifest.json

## Next Steps

Once you run the test:

1. **If it works:** âœ… MCP connection is functional!
   - We can proceed with automated Unity operations
   - I can help set up prefabs, scenes, etc.

2. **If there are issues:** I'll troubleshoot based on the error messages

## Clean MCP Config

I also cleaned up your `mcp.json` file - removed the empty server entries, keeping only the Unity MCP server.

## Try It Now!

In Unity Editor, go to: **Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Test MCP Connection**
