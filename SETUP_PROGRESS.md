## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### "Type or namespace name 'PlayerInfo' could not be found"
**Solution:** Your project uses `PlayerHealth` instead. I've updated the code to use PlayerHealth.

### "Type or namespace name 'PlayerMovement' could not be found"
**Solution:** Check your player movement script name. You might have `PlayerController` or similar.

### "Type or namespace name 'Weapon' could not be found"
**Solution:** Verify Weapon.cs exists in Assets/Scripts/Weapons/

### Abilities not activating?
**Solution:** 
1. Check AbilitySystem component is on Player
2. Verify RaceData is assigned
3. Check Console for initialization messages

### No damage multiplier working?
**Solution:** Make sure your Player has both:
- AbilitySystem component
- RaceData assigned to AbilitySystem

## üìö What Each Script Does:

### AbilitySystem.cs
- Manages all abilities for a race
- Handles Q/E/F key inputs
- Applies race stat multipliers (HP, speed, damage)
- Manages mana for Blood Elf
- Creates ability instances based on race

### Ability.cs (Base Class)
- Handles cooldowns
- Checks mana costs
- Provides helper methods (GetValue, GetSecondaryValue)
- Manages activation logic

### Orc Abilities:
- **CriticalStrike**: Hooks into weapon.onBeforeShoot, rolls for crit chance
- **Bash**: Hooks into weapon.onHitEnemy, rolls for stun chance
- **Reincarnation**: Hooks into playerInfo.onDeath, respawns after 2s delay

### Human Abilities:
- **DevotionAura**: Hooks into playerHealth.onBeforeTakeDamage, reduces incoming damage
- **Invisibility**: Sets player renderer alpha to low value for duration
- **Teleport**: Raycasts forward, teleports player to destination

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next:

Once you've tested Orc:

1. **Create Human race** (try Teleport - very visible!)
2. **Create more weapon data** (AK-47, M4A4, AWP)
3. **Test Critical Strike** damage multipliers
4. **Create remaining races** (Night Elf, Undead, etc.)
