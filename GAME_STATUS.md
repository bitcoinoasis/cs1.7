## ⚠️ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Bot Tag Error (FIXED - Requires Restart)
**Issue:** "Tag: Bot is not defined" error on first Play mode run
**Status:** Fixed in code with try-catch
**Workaround:** Stop and restart Play mode once - tag will load on second run
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Core/CompleteGameSetup.cs` line 311-316

### NavMesh Not Baked (Expected)
**Issue:** Bots spawn but don't move
**Status:** Expected behavior - NavMesh optional for testing
**Solution:** Bake NavMesh via Window → AI → Navigation
**Impact:** Bots spawn and exist but won't navigate until NavMesh baked

### Audio Listener Duplicate Warning (Non-Critical)
**Issue:** "There are 2 audio listeners in the scene"
**Status:** Non-critical warning
**Cause:** Scene has Main Camera with AudioListener + Player camera adds another
**Impact:** None - Unity uses first one found

## 🎮 How to Test

### First Time Setup

2. Open scene: `Assets/cs1.7.unity`
3. Find "GameSetup" GameObject in Hierarchy
