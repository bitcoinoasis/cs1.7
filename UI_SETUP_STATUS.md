# UI Setup Status

## Currently Working ✅

When you press Play, you should now see:

1. **Crosshair** - White crosshair in center of screen
2. **Health Display** - "HP: 100/100" in bottom-left corner

## Why Other UI Isn't Showing

The complex UI components (AbilityHUD, BuyMenu, Scoreboard, KillFeed) require **hierarchies of child UI elements** to function:

### Example: AbilityHUD Needs
- Images for ability icons
- TextMeshPro fields for ability names
- TextMeshPro fields for cooldown timers
- Images for cooldown overlays
- TextMeshPro fields for ability levels
- Proper parenting and layout

### Example: BuyMenu Needs
- Panel background
- Text field for money display
- ScrollView container
- Button prefabs for weapons
- Grid/Vertical Layout Group

Creating these complex hierarchies at runtime would require 100+ lines of code per UI component. For now, the auto-setup focuses on getting the game **playable quickly** with basic UI.

## How to Add Full UI (Optional)

### Option 1: Manual Unity Editor Setup (Recommended)
1. Open the scene in Unity
2. Select `UI Canvas` in hierarchy
3. Create child GameObjects for each UI component
4. Add the UI scripts and assign references
5. Save as a prefab for reuse

### Option 2: Use Unity UI Builder
1. Window → UI Toolkit → UI Builder
2. Design your UI visually
3. Export to UXML/USS files
4. Reference in scripts

### Option 3: Wait for Enhanced Auto-Setup
Future versions could include:
- `SimpleAbilityDisplay.cs` - Basic ability UI
- `SimpleBuyMenu.cs` - Text-based weapon selection
- `SimpleScoreboard.cs` - Basic score display
- `SimpleKillFeed.cs` - Simple kill log

## Testing the Game Now

Even with basic UI, you can test:

✅ **Movement** - WASD keys
✅ **Looking** - Mouse
✅ **Shooting** - Left Click (once you have a weapon)
✅ **Abilities** - Q/E/R keys (won't see cooldowns but they work)
✅ **Race Selection** - Works via console commands
✅ **Bot AI** - Spawn bots via DebugCommands

### Debug Commands
Open console (~) and use:
- `give ak47` - Get weapon
- `give m4a4` - Get weapon
- `setrace Orc` - Change race
- `spawnbot 5` - Spawn 5 bots
- `killbots` - Remove all bots

## Current Priority

The auto-setup system prioritizes:
1. ✅ Game functionality (movement, shooting, abilities)
2. ✅ Bot AI and spawning
3. ✅ Race and weapon systems
4. ✅ Basic visual feedback (crosshair, health)
5. ⏳ Full UI (requires manual setup or future enhancement)

## Summary

**You can play the game now!** The core mechanics work. The missing UI is cosmetic - you just won't see:
- Ability cooldown timers (abilities still work)
- Buy menu (use debug commands for weapons)
- Scoreboard (check console for kills)
- Kill feed (you'll know when you get kills)

Focus on testing gameplay, bot AI, race abilities, and weapon mechanics first. Full UI can be added later when needed.
