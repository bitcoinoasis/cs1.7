# CS 1.7 Game Foundation - Complete

## 🎯 Project Status: Foundation Complete!

All foundation work is complete. The game now has a professional, production-ready structure with clean architecture and CI/CD pipeline.

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Code Reorganization (56 files moved)
**Structure:**
```
Assets/Scripts/
├── Core/ - EventSystem, ServiceLocator, SceneController, GameManager
├── Gameplay/ - Player, Bot, Combat, GameModes
├── Systems/ - Economy, Abilities, Races
├── UI/ - Menus, HUD, Feedback
├── Data/ - ScriptableObject definitions
├── Utilities/ - Helper classes
├── Initialization/ - Scene setup
├── Editor/Tools/ - Editor utilities
├── Weapons/ - Weapon system
└── Tests/ - CI/CD ready test infrastructure
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear organization by feature
- ✅ Scalable for team development
- ✅ Industry-standard layout
- ✅ Git history preserved
- ✅ Zero compilation errors

### 2. Core Architecture Foundation

#### EventSystem.cs
- **Purpose:** Loosely coupled communication
- **Features:**
  - Observer pattern implementation
  - Type-safe event subscriptions
  - 30+ predefined game events (GameEvents constants)
  - Event data classes (CombatEventData, MoneyEventData, AbilityEventData)
  - Publish/Subscribe model

**Usage Example:**
```csharp
// Subscribe to events
EventSystem.Instance.Subscribe<CombatEventData>(GameEvents.KILL_CONFIRMED, OnKillConfirmed);

// Publish events
EventSystem.Instance.Publish(GameEvents.KILL_CONFIRMED, new CombatEventData(attacker, victim, damage));
```

#### ServiceLocator.cs
- **Purpose:** Dependency management without tight coupling
- **Features:**
  - Register/Get/Unregister services
  - Type-safe service retrieval
  - Static `Services` accessor for convenience
  - Null-safety with TryGet pattern

**Usage Example:**
```csharp
// Register services
Services.Register(economySystem);
Services.Register(abilitySystem);

// Get services
var economy = Services.Get<EconomySystem>();
if (Services.TryGet<AbilitySystem>(out var abilities)) { }
```

#### SceneController.cs
- **Purpose:** Scene loading and transitions
- **Features:**
  - Async scene loading with progress tracking
  - Loading events via EventSystem
  - Scene reload functionality
  - Min loading time for smooth transitions

**Usage Example:**
```csharp
SceneController.Instance.LoadScene("Main", () => {
    Debug.Log("Scene loaded!");
});
```

#### GameManager.cs (Enhanced)
- **Purpose:** Main game state management
- **Features:**
  - Integrated with EventSystem
  - Registered with ServiceLocator
  - Round management
  - Player tracking
  - Demo mode support

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)

**Features:**
- ✅ Automated testing on push/PR
- ✅ Multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Code quality analysis
- ✅ Auto-deploy to Itch.io (on main branch)
- ✅ GitHub Releases creation
- ✅ Test result uploads
- ✅ Build artifact caching

**Workflow Stages:**
1. **Build & Test** - Run Unity tests, build for all platforms
2. **Code Quality** - Static analysis, TODO detection
3. **Deploy** - Auto-publish to Itch.io (main branch only)
4. **Release** - Create GitHub release with binaries

**Required Secrets (for full CI/CD):**
- `UNITY_LICENSE` - Unity license file
- `UNITY_EMAIL` - Unity account email
- `UNITY_PASSWORD` - Unity account password
- `BUTLER_API_KEY` - Itch.io butler API key
- `ITCH_USER` - Your itch.io username

### 4. MCP Unity Integration

**Created Tools:**
- `MCPConnectionTest.cs` - Test MCP connection
- `CreateBotPrefab.cs` - Generate bot prefabs
- Verified working connection

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files Reorganized:** 56
- **New Core Systems:** 3 (EventSystem, ServiceLocator, SceneController)
- **Game Events Defined:** 30+
- **Compilation Errors:** 0
- **Git Commits:** Preserved full history
- **CI/CD Platforms:** 3 (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Loose coupling between systems
- Easy to add new features
- Testable components

### 2. **Service Locator Pattern**
- Centralized service access
- No global singletons pollution
- Easy dependency injection

### 3. **Singleton Pattern** (where appropriate)
- GameManager, EventSystem, SceneController
- DontDestroyOnLoad for persistence
- Thread-safe lazy initialization

### 4. **Observer Pattern**
- EventSystem implementation
- UI responds to game events
- No direct dependencies

## 🎮 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Weapon System (Priority)
- Create 20 weapon prefabs with primitive models
- Weapon categories (Rifles, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, Heavy)
- Integrate with EventSystem for combat events

### Phase 2: UI System
- Self-contained UI components
- Generate own hierarchies
- Event-driven updates

### Phase 3: Bot AI
- Combat behavior
- Pathfinding
- Team coordination
- Event-based communication

### Phase 4: Race Abilities
- Implement all 24 abilities
- Visual effects
- Event publishing

### Phase 5: Map & Gameplay
- Test map with primitives
- Spawn points
- Cover objects
- Game mode testing

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish
- Write unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance optimization
- Balance tuning

## 📝 Documentation

### For Developers:
- **EventSystem:** See GameEvents constants for all events
- **ServiceLocator:** Register all major systems on Awake()
- **SceneController:** Use for all scene transitions
- **Code Style:** Follow Unity C# naming conventions

### Key Conventions:
- **Namespaces:** `CS17.Core`, `CS17.Gameplay`, `CS17.UI`
- **Events:** Use GameEvents constants, never magic strings
- **Services:** Register in Awake(), Get in Start()
- **Folders:** Feature-based, not type-based

## 🚀 How to Use

### Running the Game:
1. Open Unity 2022.3.10f1 or later
2. Open scene: `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`
3. Press Play
4. SceneInitializer will auto-create all systems

### Adding New Features:
1. Create script in appropriate folder (Gameplay/, Systems/, etc.)
2. Use namespace (`namespace CS17.Gameplay { }`)
3. Register services if needed
4. Publish events for major actions
5. Subscribe to relevant events

### Testing:
1. Write tests in `Assets/Tests/`
2. EditMode tests for logic
3. PlayMode tests for integration
4. CI will auto-run on push

### Deploying:
1. Push to main branch
2. CI builds automatically
3. Auto-deploys to Itch.io
4. Creates GitHub release
