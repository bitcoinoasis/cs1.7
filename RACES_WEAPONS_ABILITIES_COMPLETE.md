3. **Counter-Play** - Every strength has a counter
4. **Progressive Power** - Higher levels feel rewarding but not broken
5. **CS 1.6 Authenticity** - Weapons match original stats

## üéØ Advanced Balance Calculations

### Effective HP Calculation:
```python
# Orc Example
base_hp = 100
orc_multiplier = 1.30
orc_hp = base_hp * orc_multiplier  # 130 HP

# Dwarf with Iron Skin Level 5
dwarf_hp = 100 * 1.25  # 125 HP
dwarf_armor = 30
effective_hp = dwarf_hp + dwarf_armor  # 155 effective HP

# Human with Devotion Aura Level 5
human_hp = 100
damage_reduction = 0.15  # 15%
effective_hp = human_hp / (1 - damage_reduction)  # 117.6 effective HP
```

### DPS Calculations:
```python
# AK-47 Base
damage_per_shot = 36
fire_rate = 0.1  # seconds between shots
base_dps = damage_per_shot / fire_rate  # 360 DPS

# Orc with Critical Strike Level 5 (average)
crit_chance = 0.20
crit_multiplier = 2.5
expected_damage = damage_per_shot * ((1 - crit_chance) + (crit_chance * crit_multiplier))
# = 36 * (0.8 + 0.5) = 46.8 per shot
orc_dps = 46.8 / 0.1  # 468 DPS (+30% average)

# Troll at 90% HP missing (Berserker Rage max)
damage_bonus = 1.20  # +20%
attack_speed_bonus = 1.40  # +40% attack speed
troll_damage = damage_per_shot * damage_bonus  # 43.2
troll_fire_rate = 0.1 / attack_speed_bonus  # 0.071 seconds
troll_dps = 43.2 / 0.071  # 608 DPS (+69% at low HP!)
```

### Time-to-Kill (TTK):
```python
# AK-47 vs different races (body shots, no armor)
def ttk(target_hp, weapon_damage, fire_rate):
    shots_needed = ceil(target_hp / weapon_damage)
    return (shots_needed - 1) * fire_rate

# vs Night Elf (85 HP)
ttk_nelf = ceil(85 / 36) = 3 shots = 0.2s

# vs Orc (130 HP)
ttk_orc = ceil(130 / 36) = 4 shots = 0.3s

# vs Orc with Human's Devotion Aura (130 HP, 15% DR)
effective_damage = 36 * 0.85 = 30.6
ttk_orc_devotion = ceil(130 / 30.6) = 5 shots = 0.4s
```

## üî¨ Advanced Mechanics

### Damage Stacking:
```
Base Damage: 36 (AK-47)
√ó Orc Damage Bonus (1.15): 41.4
√ó Critical Strike (2.5x): 103.5
√ó Headshot Multiplier (4x): 414 damage!

= Orc can deal 414 damage with crit headshot
= Instakills through any armor/HP combination
```

### Speed Stacking:
```
Base Speed: 250 units/second
√ó Night Elf (1.20): 300 units/second
√ó Knife Boost (1.0): 300 (no weapon boost)
√ó Celestial Aura (1.15): 345 units/second!

= Fastest possible: Night Elf + Celestial support
= 38% faster than baseline
```

### Ultimate Ability Combos:
```
Devastating Combos:
1. Orc Reincarnation + Troll Berserker Rage
   = Respawn with low HP in max rage mode

2. Night Elf Evasion + Human Devotion Aura
   = 22% dodge + 15% DR = 37% effective mitigation

3. Celestial Divine Shield + Blood Elf Mana Shield
   = 3.5s invuln + 60 mana shield = extreme survivability

4. Dwarf Entrenchment + Celestial Aura of Light
   = 50% DR + 15% speed = mobile fortress for team

5. Undead Unholy Aura + Troll Throwing Axes
   = Damage over time + slow = zone control
```

## üìù Final Balance Notes

### Design Philosophy Recap:
1. **Every race viable** - No must-picks or auto-losses
2. **Counters exist** - Rock-paper-scissors dynamics
3. **Skill expression** - Better players win with any race
4. **Team synergy** - Combos reward coordination
5. **Economic balance** - Money matters, abilities don't replace gunplay

### Future Balance Patches:
```yaml
Planned Adjustments:
  - Orc Critical Strike: May reduce level 5 to 18% (from 20%)
  - Night Elf Evasion: May cap at 20% (from 22%)
  - Blood Elf Mana Shield: May reduce regen to 1.5/sec (from 2/sec)
  - Troll Berserker: May add scaling at 25-50% HP
  - Celestial Divine Shield: May reduce to 3.0s max (from 3.5s)

Reasoning: After playtesting, slight tweaks may be needed
```

### Community Feedback Loop:
```
Week 1-2: Gather data from beta testers
Week 3-4: Identify overperforming races
Week 5-6: Implement balance patch v1.1
Week 7-8: Monitor and iterate
Week 9-10: Finalize for competitive release
```
