## Testing Your Abilities

### In Play Mode:
- **Critical Strike:** Just shoot normally - you'll see yellow damage numbers when it procs
- **Bash:** Shoot enemies - they'll be stunned (can't move) when it procs
- **Reincarnation:** Die - you'll respawn at death location after 2 seconds

### Debug Commands (if enabled):
- **1** - Add XP
- **2** - Level Up (increases ability power!)
- **C** - Reset all cooldowns

### Console Messages to Watch:
```
[AbilitySystem] Initialized race: Orc at level 1
[CriticalStrike] Initialized. Chance: 8%, Multiplier: 1.5x
[Bash] Initialized. Chance: 5%, Duration: 0.3s
[Reincarnation] Initialized. Respawn HP: 25%
```

## Ability Interactions

### Critical Strike
- Works with **all weapons**
- Multiplies **final damage** (after armor)
- Visible yellow numbers on crit
- Stacks with race damage bonus (105%)

### Bash
- Only procs on **hit confirmation**
- 3-second cooldown **per target** (can stun multiple enemies)
- Stunned enemies can still shoot, just can't move
- Great for AWP follow-up shots

### Reincarnation
- **Countered by headshots** - no respawn if killed by headshot
- **Once per round** - hasUsedThisRound flag
- **2-second delay** - vulnerable during animation
- **50% ammo loss** - strategic penalty
- Respawns at **exact death position**

---

## Balance Philosophy

**Orc = Aggressive Powerhouse**
- High HP (115%) = Can take more damage in fights
- Damage boost (105%) = Rewards aggressive play
- Slight speed penalty (95%) = Can't run away easily
- Critical Strike = RNG burst damage for kills
- Bash = Utility for securing kills
- Reincarnation = Second chance, but heavily punished by headshots

**Counters:**
- Night Elf Evasion (dodge crits)
- Night Elf Thorns (reflect damage)
- Headshots (prevent Reincarnation)
- Kiting (exploit low speed)
