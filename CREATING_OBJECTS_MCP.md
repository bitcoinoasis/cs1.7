# Creating Game Objects via MCP Connection

## âœ… Test Successful!

The MCP connection is working! I've now created useful prefab generation scripts for your game.

## ðŸŽ® New Commands Available

### In Unity Editor, go to menu: **Tools â†’ CS 1.7**

You now have these commands:

### 1. Create Bot Prefab
**Menu:** `Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Create Bot Prefab`

**What it creates:**
- Complete Bot prefab at `Assets/Prefabs/Bot.prefab`
- CharacterController (height: 2, radius: 0.5)
- NavMeshAgent (speed: 5, acceleration: 8)
- BotAI component
- PlayerHealth component
- PlayerController component
- PlayerRace component
- AbilitySystem component
- Orange capsule visual
- WeaponHolder GameObject

**Ready to use with BotSpawner!**

### 2. Create Player Prefab
**Menu:** `Tools â†’ CS 1.7 â†’ Create Player Prefab`

**What it creates:**
- Complete Player prefab at `Assets/Prefabs/Player.prefab`
- CharacterController
- PlayerController
- PlayerHealth

- AbilitySystem
- Camera with AudioListener at eye level (1.6m)
- WeaponHolder for weapons

**Ready to spawn in game!**

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Run the commands** in Unity to create the prefabs
2. The prefabs will be saved in `Assets/Prefabs/` folder
3. BotSpawner can now use the Bot prefab automatically
4. You can instantiate the Player prefab in scenes

## ðŸ“‹ Benefits of These Prefabs

âœ… **Consistent Setup** - Same configuration every time
âœ… **Reusable** - Drag into any scene
âœ… **Version Control Friendly** - Prefabs are text files
âœ… **Easy to Modify** - Edit once, updates everywhere
âœ… **BotSpawner Compatible** - Bot prefab works with BotSpawnerAutoSetup.cs

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Demonstrates

- âœ… Create GameObjects

- âœ… Configure properties
- âœ… Create prefabs
- âœ… Save to disk
- âœ… Organize in folders
